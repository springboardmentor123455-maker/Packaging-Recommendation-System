🌱 EcoPackAI – AI-Powered Sustainable Packaging Recommendation System

EcoPackAI is an AI-driven web application designed to recommend sustainable and cost-efficient packaging materials based on specific product requirements. The system integrates machine learning models, sustainability metrics, business intelligence dashboards, and cloud deployment to enable data-driven and environmentally responsible packaging decisions for businesses.

📌 Problem Statement

Selecting eco-friendly packaging materials is a complex task that requires balancing multiple factors such as:

Environmental impact (CO₂ emissions, biodegradability)

Material performance (strength, weight capacity, water resistance)

Cost efficiency

Traditional packaging selection methods are largely manual, subjective, and lack quantitative evaluation. These limitations often result in higher environmental impact and inefficient material usage. EcoPackAI addresses this challenge by providing an automated, AI-based recommendation system that objectively evaluates packaging materials using data-driven intelligence.

🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of EcoPackAI are to:

Collect and manage eco-friendly packaging material data

Perform data cleaning and feature engineering

Build machine learning models for cost and CO₂ impact prediction

Recommend optimal packaging materials using AI-based ranking

Develop an interactive web-based user interface

Build a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard for sustainability insights

Deploy the application on cloud infrastructure

Provide complete technical documentation and project demonstration
